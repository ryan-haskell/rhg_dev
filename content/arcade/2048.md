### Controls

Use your arrow keys or touch controls to slide tiles up, down, left, or right.

When two tiles with the same value collide, they'll combine into one tile with double the value!

Can you keep combining tiles until you reach 2048?


### Mobile-friendly

This game also has touch controls, so you can play it on your iPhone, Android, or tablet.
