### How to play

You are the __brown__ pirate ship in the center. Tap an __adjacent or diagonal__ tile to move.

Once you move, the enemy ships in red will move towards you, even diagonally. If a enemy ship can crash into youâ€“ you lose!

Tap on your own tile to __fire cannons__ from the __side of your ship__. Cannons destroy all enemies within three tiles of your ship. Enemy ships _still_ get a turn after you fire!

You complete a level by destroying all enemy ships in one of three ways:

1. Have them crash into __islands__
1. Have them crash into __each other__
1. Blast them with a __cannonball__

### Whirlpools

Those freaky spinny things in the corners are whirlpools, moving there will randomly teleport you somewhere else on the grid. Use them if there are no other options!
