### Controls

__Left click__ on an emoji. When one is selected, you click an __adjacent__ emoji to swap them. 

If that swap would __create a line__ of __3 or more__ matching emojis, you score points! (If not, the emojis will stay in their original positions)

### Highscore!

This game also has a __Highscore__ feature, which will keep your best score in your web browser's storageâ€“ so it will still be available the next time you play the game.
