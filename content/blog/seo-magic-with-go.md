### I create web stuff

Occasionally, I like to share that stuff with people via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhg_dev). When I share a link to a blog post, like this one, Twitter scans the __"meta tags"__ on my site. It uses those _meta tags_ to determine how to render a tiny summary of the blog post.

To understand what Twitter sees, you can [view the page source](view-source:https://rhg.dev/blog/seo-magic-with-go/) for this blog post. The HTML shown at that URL is how social media platforms, and search engines like Google can access basic data about your web pages.

For all my blog posts, there are three `<meta>` tags I use to tell Twitter how I want my links to render when this page is shared:

```html
<meta name="twitter:card"
      content="summary" />

<meta name="twitter:site"
      content="@rhg_dev" />

<meta name="twitter:image"
      content="https://rhg.dev/gen/seo/magic.jpg" />
```

- `twitter:card` says I want a small `summary` card, not a big image preview
- `twitter:site` attributes this link to my Twitter handle
- `twitter:image` is what the image I want to see in my preview.

### The big plan

Up until a day ago, I was using the _same_ Twitter preview image for all links shared from this website. For example, even though my [Advent of Code](../aoc-2021) article had an __adorable snowman emoji__, I would show the same "waving hand" emoji centered on a pink-to-orange gradient.

I wanted to have each link have a __distinct emoji__ that matched up with the theme of the content. This is what my last post looks like, now that I've successfully implemented the feature:

![Two twitter posts showing different](./1-twitter.jpg)

If I wanted to have a custom preview like the one above for __every__ new blog post I wrote, here's what the manual workflow would look like:

1. Find a good 128x128 emoji to match the article.
1. Place it in the `./static/images` folder.
1. Open up an image editor like [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) or Photoshop.
1. Overlay the emoji on a pink-to-orange gradient.
1. Export the combined image into the `./static/seo` folder
1. Repeat `x` times for each new image.

Over time, this would get _pretty_ tedious and error-prone. I wanted a solution that would __automate__ this workflow for me that I could run once __at build time__.

### Let's solve the problem!

I host my website on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and it is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Any time I make an update to my blog, I push that update to [GitHub](https://github.com/ryannhg). From there, _Netlify_ detects the new change and builds my _Hugo_ project with this command.

Because I write my blog posts in __markdown__, I'm also able to store metadata about each post in YAML at the top of the file. This YAML is usually referred to as __"frontmatter"__. Here's a glimpse at what the frontmatter looks like for the blog post you're currently reading:

```yaml
title: "SEO Magic with Go"
subtitle: "a tiny little script that generates JPEGs"
image: "magic"
```

For this blog post, the `image` field is set to `"magic"`. When rendering this page layout in HTML, I'm able to access the `image` parameter in the hero at the top of this page. This is what that HTML layout code looks like:

```html
<div class="hero">
  <div class="hero__image"
    style="background-image: url('/images/{{ .Params.image }}.png')"
  ></div>
  <h1 class="hero__title">{{ .Params.title }}</h1>
  <h2 class="hero__subtitle">{{ .Params.subtitle }}</h2>
</div>
```

When Hugo combines this HTML layout with my markdown content, this is the HTML sent to your web browser:

```html
<div class="hero">
  <div class="hero__image"
    style="background-image: url('/images/magic.png')"
  ></div>
  <h1 class="hero__title">SEO Magic with Go</h1>
  <h2 class="hero__subtitle">a tiny little script that generates JPEGs</h2>
</div>
```

The `.hero__image` now points to the file `./static/images/magic.png`. This is because _Hugo_ uses the `static` folder as a place to store __top-level assets__ like images or a `/robots.txt` file.


#### Sharing images on Twitter

Earlier in the post, we learned that the `twitter:image` meta tag is how _Twitter_ knows what image to show users. With _Hugo_, we can use the same HTML layout + frontmatter trick to create our `meta` tag:

```html
<meta
  name="twitter:image"
  content="https://rhg.dev/gen/seo/{{ .Params.image }}.jpg" />
```

Just like before, _Hugo_ replaces `{{ .Params.image }}` with the image for our blog post: `"magic"`. Here is the final HTML that _Twitter_ sees:

```html
<meta
  name="twitter:image"
  content="https://rhg.dev/gen/seo/magic.jpg" />
```

So farâ€“ everything we did is wonderful! But we can't stop here, because _Twitter_ will is expecting a file to exist at `./static/gen/seo/magic.jpg`... and we haven't created one yet!

### _Go_ to the rescue!

Because the _Netlify_ build server already has [Go](https://go.dev) installed, we can make a script that generates an image for each emoji found in the `./static/images` folder. 

Here's a __sick visual__ of what I want to happen for each PNG in that folder:

![A drawing of an equation where a transparent magic image is added to a pink-to-orange gradient image, resulting in a final combined image of a magic on top of the gradient](./2-combining-images.jpg)

I'm not really familiar with writing Go scripts, but I'm __pretty good__ at typing things into Google. After searching for how to combine images in Go, I found a [helpful example](https://www.golangprograms.com/how-to-add-watermark-or-merge-two-image.html) almost _identical_ to what I wanted to do!

I took the script found in the link above, and created a new folder called `./scripts/seo-image-gen` to put my new Go stuff:

```bash
# Make our folder
mkdir -p scripts/seo-image-gen

# Hop to it!
cd scripts/seo-image-gen
```

Next, I created a new _Go_ app in that folder using the `go` CLI:

```bash
go mod init github.com/ryannhg/seo-image-gen
```

In _Go_, the `main` function is the entrypoint to the application. That means when we call `go run main.go` later on from the terminal, our program will run the `main` function.

Here's what our `main` function looks like:

```go
package main

func main() {
  // Step 1: Load the background gradient PNG
  bgImage := loadBackgroundImage()

  // Step 2: Make sure the output folder exists
  ensureOuputFolderExists()

  // Step 3: Create a new file for each PNG image
  count := createImagesWithBackground(bgImage)

  // Step 4: Print out a success message
  printSuccessMessage(count)
}
```

Lets dive into the implementation of each of these functions to see how they work!

#### Step 1: `loadBackgroundImage`

Within our `scripts/seo-image-gen` folder, I created a new folder called `backgrounds`. Within _that_ folder, I created a 256x256 PNG image showing the pink-to-orange gradient.

This image doesn't have any emojis overlayed on it, so it will be reused for all the images we generate later on:

```go
func loadBackgroundImage() image.Image {
  // Load the PNG from the filesystem
  bgFile, err := os.Open("backgrounds/square.png")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to open: %s", err)
  }

  // Decode the PNG
  bgImage, err := png.Decode(bgFile)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to decode: %s", err)
  }
  defer bgFile.Close()

  // Return that image
  return bgImage
}
```

_Go_ comes with the ability to easily read files and decode images baked-in. This was great, because I didn't need any 3rd party packages to make the script work!

#### Step 2. `ensureOuputFolderExists`

When we get to the part where we need to create files like `static/gen/seo/magic.jpeg`, we will get an error if the `static/gen/seo` folder does not exist.

That's where this function comes in to save the day:

```go
func ensureOuputFolderExists() {
  os.MkdirAll("../../static/gen/seo", os.ModePerm)
}
```

Here, I chose to call `os.MkdirAll` instead of the standard `os.Mkdir` function. This is because `os.MkdirAll` will "recursively" create folders. 

What this means for _our_ script is that it will create both `gen` and `seo`, without requiring `gen` to already exist. ( Just like how `mkdir -p` works in the terminal )

#### Step 3: `createImagesWithBackground`

To create these new images, we need to do a few things:

1. List all the files the `./static/images` folder.
1. Draw the PNG emoji over the PNG gradient.
1. Save that as a JPEG to the output folder.

As we go along, I also wanted to keep track of __how many__ images were created. This is returned as `count` to the caller of the function:

```go
func createImagesWithBackground(bgImage image.Image) int {
  // Read all files in the "static/images" folder
  files, err := os.ReadDir("../../static/images")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to read folder: %s", err)
  }

  // Will track how many JPEG files were generated
  count := 0

  for _, file := range files {
    // Get filename, without extension
    nameWithExt := file.Name()
    filename := strings.TrimSuffix(nameWithExt, filepath.Ext(nameWithExt))

    // Ignore non-PNG files
    if filepath.Ext(nameWithExt) == ".png" {
      count++
      createCombinedFile(bgImage, filename)
    }
  }

  return count
}
```

The `for` loop also calls a function for each image, called `createCombinedFile`. That's where we actually combine and create images:

```go
func createCombinedFile(bgImage image.Image, filename string) {
  // Define input & output filepaths
  inputFilepath := fmt.Sprintf("../../static/images/%s.png", filename)
  outputFilepath := fmt.Sprintf("../../static/gen/seo/%s.jpg", filename)

  // Load foreground PNG image file
  fgFile, err := os.Open(inputFilepath)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to open: %s", err)
  }

  // Decode the file as a PNG image
  fgImage, err := png.Decode(fgFile)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to decode: %s", err)
  }
  defer fgFile.Close()

  // Describe expected image dimensions and offset
  bgBounds := image.Rect(0, 0, 256, 256)

  fgOffset := image.Pt(64, 64)
  fgBounds := image.Rect(0, 0, 128, 128).Add(fgOffset)

  // Validate against actual image dimensions
  actualFgBounds := fgImage.Bounds().Size()

  // Exit with helpful error if a PNG is not 128x128
  if actualFgBounds.X != 128 || actualFgBounds.Y != 128 {
    printInvalidImageError(filename, actualFgBounds)
  }

  // Create a new combined image
  combinedImage := image.NewRGBA(bgBounds)
  draw.Draw(combinedImage, bgBounds, bgImage, image.Point{}, draw.Src)
  draw.Draw(combinedImage, fgBounds, fgImage, image.Point{}, draw.Over)

  // Save the combined image to the filesystem
  combinedFile, err := os.Create(outputFilepath)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to create: %s", err)
  }
  jpeg.Encode(combinedFile, combinedImage, &jpeg.Options{Quality: jpeg.DefaultQuality})
  defer combinedFile.Close()
}
```

There are a few steps in the code above, but the interesting thing to notice is the validation step. When I initially ran this program, one of my emojis was 256x256. This led to an __incorrectly rendered__ imageâ€“ where the icon was clipped in half!

I know I'm not a clever man, and manually reviewing all images will only get harder as a make more and more contentâ€“ so I wanted to create a helpful error message.

That involved defining the `printInvalidImageError` function, which prints a helpful error message if something went wrong:

```go
func printInvalidImageError(filename string, actualBounds image.Point) {
  log.Fatalf(
    "\n\n  Problem with %s./static/images/%s.png%s :\n\n    Expected size %s128x128%s, found %s%dx%d%s\n\n",
    YELLOW,
    filename,
    RESET,
    GREEN,
    RESET,
    CYAN,
    actualBounds.X,
    actualBounds.Y,
    RESET,
  )
}
```

To make the error easier to read, I searched for an article on how to use [terminal color codes in Go](https://twin.sh/articles/35/how-to-add-colors-to-your-console-terminal-output-in-go). If an image is the wrong size, we get a message that tells us which file we need to change:

![An error message in the terminal, showing that magic.png has size 256 by 256 instead of 128 by 128](./3-error-output.jpg)

Here, the `magic.png` I added is too bigâ€“ so I'll need to edit the size before my script will finish successfully.

#### Step 4: `printSuccessMessage`

The very last function in this script prints a happy success message if everything worked out alright.

```go
func printSuccessMessage(count int) {
	log.Printf(
		"\n\n %s%d%s SEO images generated!\n\n",
		GREEN,
		count,
		RESET,
	)
}
```

If all the images are the correct size, here's what I get after running the script from my terminal:

![A success message reading '14 SEO images have been generated!'](./4-success-output.jpg)


### Deploying to Netlify

Now that everything works locally, I'll need to let _Netlify_ know to run this on builds. I already have a `netlify.toml` configuration file at the root of my project that tells _Netlify_ how to build my project.

This is what my build configuration looked like before:

```toml
# Config for hosting via https://netlify.com
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "hugo"
```

And here's what it looks like now:

```toml
# Config for hosting via https://netlify.com
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "(cd scripts/seo-image-gen && go run main.go) && hugo"
```

Using parentheses around the `cd` and `go run` commands means I won't be in the `scripts/seo-image-gen` folder when it comes time to run `hugo` to build my code.

I also learned the hard way that it's important my script __runs before `hugo`__. This way, the static files are correctly placed into the final `public` folder and published to the web!

#### Creating bug-free vibes

The best part of adding the image size validation step is that _Netlify_ __won't build__ if I accidentally upload an invalid image. Because the _Go_ script we wrote returns a non-zero exit code, the build will not pass. 

That means users will __never experience this problem__, because it can't make it into production.


### My first production _Go_ script!

This blog post broke our _Go_ script into small chunks, so I could walk you through how it works.
