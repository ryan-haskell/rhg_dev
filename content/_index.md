### Welcome!

{{< pic >}} My name is Ryan Haskell and this is my personal website. If you are here to [play some games](/arcade) or [read some blog posts](/blog)– you've come to the right place!

I'm a professional web developer, living in Chicago with my lovely wife.

I like creating websites, web applications, and design systems. I also _love_ making games, so I'm currently learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

In my free time, I'm usually creating something in my favorite language: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). My positive experience with Elm inspired me to design the [Elm Land](https://elm.land) framework. The goal for Elm Land is to make Elm easier for frontend developers coming from React, Vue, and other JS frameworks.

If you are curious about Elm, feel free to watch one of my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@HeyRyanHaskell) tutorials. Thanks for stopping by!
