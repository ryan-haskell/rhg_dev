### Welcome!

{{< pic >}} My name is Ryan Haskell-Glatz and this is my personal website. If you are here to [play some games](/arcade) or [read some blog posts](/blog)– you've come to the right place!

I just started my own indie game studio, [Limited Creativity](https://limited-creativity.com). Our first game is [Turbo Champ](https://turbo-champ.com), a fast-pased, arcade game designed to play with friends! 

My professional experience is creating websites, web applications, and design systems. I also _love_ making games, so I'm currently learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

In my free time, I'm usually making something with my favorite language: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). My positive experience with Elm inspired me to make the [Elm Land](https://elm.land) framework. The goal for Elm Land is  to make Elm more accessible for frontend developers coming from React, Vue, or other JS frameworks.

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhg_dev), hang out with me live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/rhg_dev), or watch any of my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/rhg_dev) tutorials. Thanks for stopping by!
