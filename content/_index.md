### Welcome!

My name is Ryan Haskell-Glatz and this is my personal website. If you are here to [play some games](/arcade) or [read some blog posts](/blog)â€“ you've come to the right place!

I'm a _Frontend Engineer_ living in Chicago and working at a remote-friendly company called [Blissfully](https://blissfully.com). I have experience creating fullstack web applications, but most of my focus is on frontend web development. I also love making web-based games, so I can easily share them with friends.

Every chance I get, I use my favorite language: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). You might already know me from the Elm community, from my work on [elm-spa](https://elm-spa.dev), an app framework I made. If not, maybe you're here because of all these pretty gradients!

I also designed this website from scratch. If you like it, be sure to tell me all about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhg_dev)! I'm _always_ happy to receive good vibes.
