### Welcome!

{{< pic >}} My name is Ryan Haskell-Glatz and this is my personal website. If you are here to [play some games](/arcade) or [read some blog posts](/blog)– you've come to the right place!

I'm a _Frontend Engineer_ living in Chicago and working at a remote-friendly company called [Vendr](https://vendr.com). I have a lot of practice creating fullstack web applications, but most of my focus is on frontend web development. I also love making web-based games, so I can easily share them with friends.

Every chance I get, I use my favorite language: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). I'm currently building on [Elm Land](https://elm.land), which is designed to make Elm easier for more frontend developers. You may already know me from my work on "elm-spa", my previous single-page application framework. 

If not, maybe you're here because of all these pretty gradients! I designed this website from scratch. If you like it, be sure to tell me all about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhg_dev)! I'm _always_ happy to receive good vibes.
