### Welcome!

My name is Ryan and you've found my personal website. If you are here to [play some games](/arcade) or read some [blog posts](/blog)– you've come to the right place!

I live in __Chicago__ and work remotely as a __Frontend Engineer__ for a NY-based startup called [Blissfully](https://blissfully.com). Although I have a bunch of experience doing fullstack web development, I really enjoy doing frontend work. I also make tiny web-based games to share with friends. 

Every chance I get, I create things with my favorite language, [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). You might know me from the Elm community, which is full of the wonderful people for whom I created a application framework called [elm-spa](https://elm-spa.dev). 

If not, maybe you're here for all these pretty colors! The website you are reading is completely __open source__. That means you can see the entire codebase [on GitHub](https://github.com/ryannhg/rhg-dev). If you like it, be sure to tell me all about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhg_dev)! I'm perpetually down for good vibes.
